# Fractal is now in Typescript

## Philosophy

We will focus on next topics:

- Simple API + simple architecture (do other diagram like architecture diagram, but focus on what is useful for users)
- Focus on small and emmbedable components
- Tasks are atomic
- Small code (removing some dependencies), ALAP
- Modules never crash at runtime, but performs a good error hadling and reporting
- Mori for persistent data structures
- Typed views via new Snabbdom with Typescript
- Better composing API
- Better and simple docs, live docs
- Behaviors optimization pattern, via tasks
- Tween.js task for animations
- Router pattern (urls)

## Dependencies

- Fractal core should not have any dependencies, this is a design choice
- Maintain package.json as simple as possible, less dependencies, less scripts ...

## Concepts

- component: is a small or big part of your app, and is designed for composition.
- group: is a container for each component that is initialized with it and handled by group handlers. Used for styles.
- interface: is the part of a component that is responsible of communications (external world, AKA side effects)
- state: is the part of a component related to their data
- action: is a part of a component and is the unique way to update its state
- task: is an information related to a specific side effect, tasks are dispatched by components via inputs (see later)
- handler: is a part of an module that handle interfaces of root component, groups or tasks. Performs certain type of side effects. Can be a task handler or an interface handler
- input: is a part of a component that is a dispatcher for actions and tasks
- lifecycle: it is a set of hooks for the execution of something. Modules and components has init and destroy hooks
- module: a module runs one component (AKA root component), connecting it to external world. A component can be composed of more components in a tree
- Fractal arquitecture: is the whole way in that data and functionality are handled

Development:

- hot swapping: hability of swapping state between updates during development

Internals:

- component context: is the context of a component merged and running in a module

## Rules

- IMPORTANT: styles showld be separated and are a function of palette and other globals (maximum customization and weight)
