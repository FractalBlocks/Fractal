# Tutorial Overview

We love simplicity and minimalism, and if you are dealing with the inherent complexity of software, you should too.

Well, lets start with the end in mind!!. Suppose you want to make a form like that:

```
Diary of
 Name   ___________
Products
 TEAS   0 [+] [-]
 Apples 0 [+] [-]
[Save]
```

We can divide it in components:

- Form
  - Teas per day - Counter
  - Apples per day - Counter
  - Name - Input
  - Animated submit button - Button

So we have built a component hierarchy. Go to the [Next step](counter.md) to see our first component!
